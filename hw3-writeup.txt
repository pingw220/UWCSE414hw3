Based on my personal experience, I find the cloud server interface extremely convenient, as it automatically presents output lines and error messages for my SQL queries. However, I believe this ease of use may be attributed to the fundamental techniques required for this assignments. Consequently, I haven't noticed a significant difference between using my own terminal and the cloud server.

Additionally, I found the SQL editor user-friendly. Features like the run button greatly facilitate database construction. I would highly recommend this system to students, as traditional terminals can sometimes be challenging to navigate. The clear error messaging and functionality like the run button are particularly beneficial for learning SQL as a beginner. On the other hand, I would also encourage professionals to try this system. Its ability to manually adjust usage and storage offers a flexible environment for project development. However, having no experience with managing large databases, I am uncertain about its performance under the load of substantial data and queries.

The above are merely my suggestions and experiences. I hope to have more opportunities to explore this server and larger database systems in the future.
